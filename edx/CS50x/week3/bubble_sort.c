/* 
Move higher valued elements generally towards to the right and lower value elements generally towards the left.

Pseudocode:
- Set swap counter to a non-zero value 
- Repeat until the swap counter is 0:
    - Reset swap counter to 0
    - Look at each adjacent pair
        - If two adjacent elements are not in order, swap them and add one to the swap counter
