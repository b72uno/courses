/* 
Build your sorted array in place - shifting elements out of the way if necessary to make room as you go.

Pseudocode:
- Call the first element of the array "sorted"
- Repeat until all elements are sorted:
    - Look at the next unsorted element. Insert into the sorted portion by shifting the requisite number of elements
