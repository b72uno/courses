    "### Generalized coordinates\n",
    "The coordinates used to describe the instantaneous configuration (snapshot in time) of a system are often called *[generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates). This therm *generalized* often refers to the notion that for some arbitrary system these could be angles, x and y coordinates or even some other quantity that has no geometrical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "** DOF = number of independent generalized coordinates **\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of independent generalized coordinates that are required to describe the configuration of a system is equal to the number of degrees of freedom. In the 2-DoF manipulator exercise we chose two particular joint angles with respect to a particular reference frame, but we could have just as easily chosen other angles with respect to some other reference frame. The number of possible choices for the generalized coordinates that describe a system is, in fact, infinite, but the smart choice of which set of coordinates to use is the one that most simplifies the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the robotics of serial manipulators, you'll often run into the term \"configuration space\" or \"joint space\", which refers to the set of all possible configurations a manipulator may have. As you'll see later in this program, understanding of the configuration space is important for *path planning* and *obstacle avoidance*.\n"

    "### Joint Types\n",
    "![](joint-types.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Joints can be grouped in lower order pairs, having one DoF and higher order pairs offering two or three DoF. For serial manipulators (aka robot arm or kinematic chain) the most common joint types are revolute and prismatic, allowing one rotational and one translational DoF respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling purposes, higher order pairs can always be replaced by a collection of lower order pairs.\n"

    "Let's define the number of 1-DoF joints to be equal to n\n",
    "\n",
    "![](dof.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The serial manipulator shown here has n=3 joints. 2 revolute (cylinders) and one prismatic (square). Each joint connects two links so the total number of links is n+1 = 4. Notice that the revolute described by theta connects the ground, i.e. fixed base link to the link between joints 1 and 2., Thus the total number of DoF for any serial manipulator with three 1-DoF joints is:\n",
    "\n",
    "DoF = 6 (number of moveable links) - 5 (number of 1-DoF joints) = 6(3) - 5(3) = (18 - 15) = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway is this: **For serial manipulators with only revolute and/or prismatic joints, the number of degrees of freedom is always equal to the number of joints.** The exception to this rule is when both ends of the manipulator are fixed (closed chain linkage), as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](exception-dof-joints.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a manipulator has more DoF than is required for its given task, it is said to be **kinematically redundant**. For example, if a three DoF arm is used to locate a rigid body on a plane, it would have one degree redundancy, since two generalized coordinates are needed to locate a point on a plane. However, to control both the position and orientation of a rigid body on a plane, a manipulator with at least three DoF is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinematically redundant manipulators have a number of advantages. The eXtra DoF means that theyu are more dexterous and better at avoiding obstacles. Because they have more flexibility in terms of path planning, they can also be more energetically efficient. However, the redundancy comes at a cost, in that they are more difficult to control"

    "##  Principal Types of Serial Manipulators\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways serial manipulators are classified are in terms of their kinematic configuration of their arm, that is *the sequence of joint types for the first three movable links*. With only **revolute (R)** and **prismatic (P)** joints, there are only 8 permutations of possible arm configurations. The following 4 are commonly used in industry:\n",

    "- Cylindrical (RPP)\n",
    "- Anthropomorphic (RRR)\n",

    "### Workspace \n",
    "Sometimes called *work volume* or *work envelope*, it is the set of all points reachable by the end effector and is a primary design constraint when selecting a manipulator for a task. The workspace can be divided into two regions: the *reachable workspace*, i.e. what is implied by the simpler term workspace, and the *dextrous workspace*. The dextrous workspace is the set of all points reachable by the end effector with an *arbitrary* orientation. The dextrous workspace is a subset of the reachable workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, e.g. machining or painting, the tool tip must interact with the environment in a particular configuration in order to have the desired result, so ensuring that the task lies completely within the manipulator's dextrous workspace, is essential. Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to precisely define the boundary of the dextrous workspace.\n",

Clearly not all nine elements are independent and more memory is required to capture the orientation information than is required using a minimal set.\n",

Also, it is a non-trivial task to interpolate smoothly between two rotation matrices (this is particularly important for computer animations when trying to generate smooth animations between key frames).\n",

Singularities of representation occur when the second rotation in sequence is such that the first and third coordinate frames become aligned, causing a loss of a degree of freedom.

It is important to note that there is nothing wrong or physically inhibiting rotational motion, it is rather a mathematical deficiency in the choice of representing rotational motions. Further, ALL conventions using only three parameters to describe orientation, suffer from singularities of representation. Therefore, a key consideration to using Euler angles in practice is to ensure that the range of motion of the object of interest does not come close to a singularity.\n"

    "## Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters\n",
    "Rotations, translations and homogenous transforms are essential concepts to understand the *forward kinematics problem* of manipulators, that is, given the joint variables, calculate the location of the end effector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution procedure involves attaching a reference frame to each link of the manipulator and writing the homogenous transforms from the fixed base link to link1, link1 to link2 and so forth, all the way to the end effector. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, *each* transform would require six independent paramters to describe frame I relative to I-1, three for position and three for orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1995, Jacques Denavit and Richard Hartenberg proposed a systematic method of attaching reference frames to the links of a manipulator that simplified the homogenous transforms. Their method only requires four parameters to describe the position and orientation of neighbouring reference frames. In the early days of robotics, the more compact forward kinematics equations provided substantial benefit as calculations were typically done by hand or on computers with limited processing power. As a result, the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) method for describing manipulator kinematic is now ubiquitous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since its original description, several modifications have been made to the DH method, mostly regarding the numbering and location of each reference frame's origin, so care must be taken to identify which convention is being used when comparing work from different sources. The five most common resources are listed below:\n",

The conventional wisdom is to choose the direction of X_i-1 such that a positive rotation of link i is intuitively satisfying. For parallel axes, there are infinitely many possibilities. In this case, you should look opportunities to place the origin of the reference frame where it can make some other paramteres equal to zero.

    "If the answer is *yes*, that is a good sign! It is also important to note that in equation(3) there is only one parameter that is variable (either theta_i or d_i) - the link length and twist angle are constants.

    "3. Draw lines through all joints, defining the joint axes\n",
    "4. Assign the Z-axis of each frame to point along its joint axis\n",
    "5. Identify the *common normal* between each frame $\\hat Z_{i-1}$ and frame $\\hat Z_i$\n",
    "6. The endpoints of \"intermediate links\" (i.e. not the base link or the end effector) are associated with two joint axes, $\\{i\\}$ and $\\{i+1\\}$. For i from 1 to n-1, assign the $\\hat X_i$ to be ...\n",
    "  - For skew axes, along the normal between $\\hat{Z}_i$ and $\\hat{Z}_{i+1}$ and pointing from {i} to {i+1}\n",
    "  - For intersecting axes, normal to the plane containing $\\hat{Z}_i$ and $\\hat{Z}_{i+1}$\n",
    "  - For parallel or coincident axes, the assignment is arbitrary - look for ways to make other DH parameters equal to zero.\n",
    "7. For the base link, always choose frame {0} to be coincident with frame {1} when the first joint variable ($\\theta_1$ or $d_1$) is equal to zero. This will guarantee that $\\alpha_0 = a_0 = 0$, and, if joint 1 is a revolute, $d_1 = 0$. If joint 1 is prismatic, then $\\theta_1 = 0$\n",
    "8. For the end effector frame, if joint n is revolute, choose $X_n$ to be in the direction of $X_{n-1}$ when $\\theta_n = 0$ and the origin of frame {n} such that $d_n = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the frame assignments are made, the DH parameters are typically represented in tabular form (below). Each row in the table corresponds to the transform from frame {i} to fram {i+1}.\n",

    "Various authors have proposed multiple conventions for assigning DH parameters. Even if two analysts use the same convention, there is no guarantee that it will result in an identical assignment of frames to links.

    "\n",
    "Step six - define positive the x-axis for all the intermediate links, i.e. for all links, excluding the base and end effector. For z-axes that are parallel, the positive x axis should point along the common normal from $z_{i-1}$ to $z_i$. See $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$. Technically $X_3$ can be pointed in any direction that is perpendicular to $Z_3$ and $Z_4$. You could think of this as a circular ring around z axes, but again, if you can make things parallel, it usually makes DH more parameters to 0. $X_3$ is down there, at the location of the gripper, to avoid the need for additional constant term -  $d_4$, which would be offset of the gripper with respect to the x-axis. \n",

    "Step seven is to assign the x axis of length 0. The number of non-zero DH parameters can always be minimized by always choosing $X_0$ coincident with $X_1$, when the first joint variable (here $\\theta_1$ is 0 and always choosing $Z_0$ to be coincident with $Z_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, step eight - assigning the x-axis for link n, the last link. Here you always choose $X_n$ to be in the same direction as $X_{n-1}$, when the last joint has a 0 angle or 0 displacement (depending on what type of joint it is), thus $X_4$ is parallel to $X_3$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The total homogenous transform relates the origin of link 0 to the origin of link 4. Notice that the origin of frame 0 is not physically connected to link 0. If you were really interested in knowing the transform relative to some point on the actual fixed base, then you could move $X_0$ down to that base, at the cost of introducing one or more non-zero DH parameters. \n",

For example, $X_0$ should map to $X_1$ and $Z_0$ should map to $Z_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Row 1** - $\\alpha_0$ is the twist angle between $Z_0$ and $Z_1$, measured about $X_0$ in a right-hand sense. $a_0$ is the distance from $Z_0$ to $Z_1$ measured along $X_0$. As $Z_0$ and $Z_1$ are colinear, $\\alpha$ and $a$ is always 0. The link offset $d_1$ is the signed distance from $X_0$ to $X_1$, measured along $Z_1$. Again, 0 because colinear. Joint 1 is revolute, so $\\theta_1$ is the only non-constant term in row one. It measures the angle between $X_0$ and $X_1$ about $Z_1$ axis in a right-hand sense. Since they are parallel, the term is just $\\theta_1$. Important note: There may be cases where the two x axes are not parallel, even though the $\\theta$ is 0. If so, the theta term would be theta plus whatever non-zero the constant offset term happens to be. *Be aware of this*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Row 2** - The transform betwen frames 1 and two. $Z_1$ is parallel to $Z_2$, so $\\alpha_1$ is again zero. $a_1$ is the distance from $Z_1$ to $Z_2$ measured along $X_1$. To find the actual numerical value for $a_1$, you would have to consult the manufacturers specs or the appropriate joint-origin tag in the manipulator's URDF file. $d_2$ is the signed distance from $X_1$ to $X_2$, measured along $Z_2$. Since $X_1$ is colinear to $X_2$, $d_2$ is zero. Joint two is another revolute, and the same logic applies as for joint one. \n",

    "**Row 3** - $Z_2$ is parallel to $Z_3$, which makes the twist angle $\\alpha_2$ equal to 0. $a_2$ is the distance between $Z_2$ and $Z_3$, measured along $X_2$. $d_3$ is the signed distance from $X_2$ to $X_3$, measured along $Z_3$. Notice that to get from $X_2$ to $X_3$, you would have to move in the negative $Z_3$ direction. Joint 3 is prismatic, which means $d_3$ is the only variable in row three, thus $\\theta_3$ is also zero. \n",
