    "### Generalized coordinates\n",
    "The coordinates used to describe the instantaneous configuration (snapshot in time) of a system are often called *[generalized coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_coordinates). This therm *generalized* often refers to the notion that for some arbitrary system these could be angles, x and y coordinates or even some other quantity that has no geometrical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "** DOF = number of independent generalized coordinates **\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of independent generalized coordinates that are required to describe the configuration of a system is equal to the number of degrees of freedom. In the 2-DoF manipulator exercise we chose two particular joint angles with respect to a particular reference frame, but we could have just as easily chosen other angles with respect to some other reference frame. The number of possible choices for the generalized coordinates that describe a system is, in fact, infinite, but the smart choice of which set of coordinates to use is the one that most simplifies the problem you're trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the robotics of serial manipulators, you'll often run into the term \"configuration space\" or \"joint space\", which refers to the set of all possible configurations a manipulator may have. As you'll see later in this program, understanding of the configuration space is important for *path planning* and *obstacle avoidance*.\n"

    "### Joint Types\n",
    "![](joint-types.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Joints can be grouped in lower order pairs, having one DoF and higher order pairs offering two or three DoF. For serial manipulators (aka robot arm or kinematic chain) the most common joint types are revolute and prismatic, allowing one rotational and one translational DoF respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For modeling purposes, higher order pairs can always be replaced by a collection of lower order pairs.\n"

    "Let's define the number of 1-DoF joints to be equal to n\n",
    "\n",
    "![](dof.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The serial manipulator shown here has n=3 joints. 2 revolute (cylinders) and one prismatic (square). Each joint connects two links so the total number of links is n+1 = 4. Notice that the revolute described by theta connects the ground, i.e. fixed base link to the link between joints 1 and 2., Thus the total number of DoF for any serial manipulator with three 1-DoF joints is:\n",
    "\n",
    "DoF = 6 (number of moveable links) - 5 (number of 1-DoF joints) = 6(3) - 5(3) = (18 - 15) = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The takeaway is this: **For serial manipulators with only revolute and/or prismatic joints, the number of degrees of freedom is always equal to the number of joints.** The exception to this rule is when both ends of the manipulator are fixed (closed chain linkage), as shown in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](exception-dof-joints.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a manipulator has more DoF than is required for its given task, it is said to be **kinematically redundant**. For example, if a three DoF arm is used to locate a rigid body on a plane, it would have one degree redundancy, since two generalized coordinates are needed to locate a point on a plane. However, to control both the position and orientation of a rigid body on a plane, a manipulator with at least three DoF is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kinematically redundant manipulators have a number of advantages. The eXtra DoF means that theyu are more dexterous and better at avoiding obstacles. Because they have more flexibility in terms of path planning, they can also be more energetically efficient. However, the redundancy comes at a cost, in that they are more difficult to control"

    "##  Principal Types of Serial Manipulators\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ways serial manipulators are classified are in terms of their kinematic configuration of their arm, that is *the sequence of joint types for the first three movable links*. With only **revolute (R)** and **prismatic (P)** joints, there are only 8 permutations of possible arm configurations. The following 4 are commonly used in industry:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Cylindrical (RPP)\n",
    "- Anthropomorphic (RRR)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Workspace \n",
    "Sometimes called *work volume* or *work envelope*, it is the set of all points reachable by the end effector and is a primary design constraint when selecting a manipulator for a task. The workspace can be divided into two regions: the *reachable workspace*, i.e. what is implied by the simpler term workspace, and the *dextrous workspace*. The dextrous workspace is the set of all points reachable by the end effector with an *arbitrary* orientation. The dextrous workspace is a subset of the reachable workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, e.g. machining or painting, the tool tip must interact with the environment in a particular configuration in order to have the desired result, so ensuring that the task lies completely within the manipulator's dextrous workspace, is essential. Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to precisely define the boundary of the dextrous workspace.\n",

Clearly not all nine elements are independent and more memory is required to capture the orientation information than is required using a minimal set.\n",

Also, it is a non-trivial task to interpolate smoothly between two rotation matrices (this is particularly important for computer animations when trying to generate smooth animations between key frames).\n",

    "The second significant drawback is singularities of representation (not to be confused with kinematic singularities). Singularities of representation occur when the second rotation in sequence is such that the first and third coordinate frames become aligned, causing a loss of a degree of freedom.

It is important to note that there is nothing wrong or physically inhibiting rotational motion, it is rather a mathematical deficiency in the choice of representing rotational motions. Further, ALL conventions using only three parameters to describe orientation, suffer from singularities of representation. Therefore, a key consideration to using Euler angles in practice is to ensure that the range of motion of the object of interest does not come close to a singularity.\n"
