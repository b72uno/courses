    "# Sentiment Analysis with an RNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis. Using an RNN rather than a feedfoward network is more accurate since we can include information about the *sequence* of words. Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture for this network is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/network_diagram.png\" width=400px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll pass in words to an embedding layer. We need an embedding layer because we have tens of thousands of words, so we'll need a more efficient representation for our input data than one-hot encoded vectors. You should have seen this before from the word2vec lesson. You can actually train up an embedding with word2vec and use it here. But it's good enough to just have an embedding layer and let the network learn the embedding table on it's own.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the embedding layer, the new representations will be passed to LSTM cells. These will add recurrent connections to the network so we can include information about the sequence of words in the data. Finally, the LSTM cells will go to a sigmoid output layer here. We're using the sigmoid because we're trying to predict if this text has positive or negative sentiment. The output layer will just be a single unit then, with a sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't care about the sigmoid outputs except for the very last one, we can ignore the rest. We'll calculate the cost from the output of the last step and the training label."

       " 'sorry everyone    i know this is supposed to be an  art  film   but wow  they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch  although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent  this story is too painful to watch  the absence of a sound track was brutal  the loooonnnnng shots were too long  how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking  especially when the dialogue is two people complaining  i really had a hard time just getting through this film  the performances were excellent  but how much of that dark  sombre  uninspired  stuff can you take  the only thing i liked was maureen stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene  otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman  and i  m no fan f his either  i think anyone who says they enjoyed     hours of this is   well  lying   ',\n",
       " 'this is not the typical mel brooks film  it was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable  leslie ann warren made the movie  she is such a fantastic  under  rated actress  there were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more  and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so  but all in all  this is worth the price to rent and see it  the acting was good overall  brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience  again  warren was the best actor in the movie  but  fume  and  sailor  both played their parts well   ',\n",
       " 'when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors  it was one of many movies i watched with my parents  but this was the only one we walked out of  since then i had never seen interiors until just recently  and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it  what a pretentious  ponderous  and painfully boring piece of    s wine and cheese tripe  woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career  in the unmistakable style of ingmar berman  allen gives us a dark  angular  muted  insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce  estrangement  career  love  non  love  halitosis  whatever  the film  intentionally  has no comic relief  no music  and is drenched in shadowy pathos  this film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature  using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a  more pronounced depth of meaning and truth   but woody allen is no ingmar bergman  the film is painfully slow and dull  but beyond that  i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters  instead i felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling  whining  nicotine stained  martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity  amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room  everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes  everyone is  lost  and  struggling   desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them  it  s never about resolution  it  s only about interminable introspective babble  it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience  s ability to connect  woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out  and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining  i see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance  i highly recommend this one if you  re feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death  otherwise  let  s just pretend this film never happened   ']"
