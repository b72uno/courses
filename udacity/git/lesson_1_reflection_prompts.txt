How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It narrows down the possible places where the bug could have been introduced. Cmon. Ez.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Being able to go back / reflect / grab some previous code? Dunno.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    When sharing files you don't always want to publish the files you've halfway written. Could go wrong in many ways.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    More control.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   You can use log to see commits, then diff the commits. If something is unclear git help log/diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always reverse them.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Everything?
