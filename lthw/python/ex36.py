# Rules, rules, rules

# every if statement must have an else
# if else shouldnt be run cause it doesnt make sense, use else: die(error msg)
# never nest if-statements more than 2 lvls and even that try to avoid.
# keep your boolean shit simple and clean

# in python use mostly for loops, while loops arent used often.
# each has its own use, no?

# do not use a debugger. Too late.
# best way to debug is to use print. Go home, Zed. You're drunk.
# do unit tests.


# Make a project. A game. Homework. SMART objectives. Blah.
# Got no time for this. Proceed.
