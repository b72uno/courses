List of what I've learned so far

- comments with # and triple quotes
- string formatting with %r when debugging for raw
  %s for string %d for digit %f for float, not sure yet whether
  all c-like formats transfer

- args from sys for unpacking variables passed with argv
- can use *argv in function to accept arbitrary amount of vars

- import sth from sth as sth
- you can use os module to maximize cross-platform compatibility
- sys - module for interacting with interpreter stuff
- File opening with open(), returns file object
- File object has methods like read, readline, seek, truncate
  write, writeline, close.
- Python has readmodes, just like C (a,w,r, additional modes + for update
        b for binary and U some fancy unicode newline support stuff I dont get.)
