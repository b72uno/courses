1.  (a) T => D ^ Y
    (b) D => ~Y
    (c) ~D => ~T or T => D
    (d)  T => ~(D ^ Y)
    (e) T ^ ~D ^ Y // from language infering that trade agreement is signed
    (f) T => (Y => ~D) // not sure about this one, how to display the condition
    (g) T => (D ^ Y) v ~(D v Y)
    (h) T => D v Y

2. ~phi    | phi implies psi | ~phi or psi
    F      | T               | T
    F      | F               | F
    T      | T               | T
    T      | T               | F

3. Truth can imply only truth. Falsity implies anything. In a disjunction only
one term needs to be true.

4. ~psi | phi implies psi | phi not implies psi | phi or ~psi
     F  | T               | F                   | F
     T  | F               | T                   | T
     F  | T               | F                   | F
     T  | T               | F                   | F


5. Same as from previous table? Not sure.
